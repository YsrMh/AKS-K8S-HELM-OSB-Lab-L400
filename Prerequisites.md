## Prerequisites

You can use the Cloud Shell for this lab, which has everything set up for you, including `kubectl` and `helm`, however if you want to use your local console, make sure you've done the following:

* Install the [Azure CLI](#install-the-azure-cli).
* Install the [Kubernetes CLI](#install-the-kubernetes-cli).
* Install the [Helm CLI](#install-the-helm-cli).

### Install the Azure CLI

Install `az` by following the instructions for your operating system.
See the [full installation instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) if yours isn't listed below.

#### MacOS

```console
brew install azure-cli
```

#### Windows

Download and run the [Azure CLI Installer (MSI)](https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCliWindows).

#### Ubuntu 64-bit

1. Add the azure-cli repo to your sources:
    ```console
    echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/azure-cli/ wheezy main" | \
         sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azure-cli.list
    ```
1. Run the following commands to install the Azure CLI and its dependencies:
    ```console
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver packages.microsoft.com --recv-keys 52E16F86FEE04B979B07E28DB02C46DF417A0893
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install azure-cli
    ```

### Install the Kubernetes CLI

Install `kubectl` by running the following command:

```console
az aks install-cli
```

### Install the Helm CLI

[Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) is a tool for installing pre-configured applications on Kubernetes.
Install `helm` by running the following command:

#### MacOS

```console
brew install kubernetes-helm
```

#### Windows

1. Download the latest [Helm release](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.7.2-windows-amd64.tar.gz).
1. Decompress the tar file.
1. Copy **helm.exe** to a directory on your PATH.

#### Linux

```console
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get | bash
```

### And finally, if you're completely new to Kubernetes, watch The Illustrated Children's Guide to Kubernetes
Seriously, watch it, it's a great way of explaining exactly how Kubernetes works without the techno-babble.
